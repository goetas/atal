/**
 * The Query Path package provides tools for manipulating a Document Object Model.
 * The two major DOMs are the XML DOM and the HTML DOM. Using Query Path, you can 
 * build, parse, search, and modify DOM documents.
 *
 * To use Query Path, this is the only file you should need to import.
 *
 * Standard usage:
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * $qp = qp('#myID', '<?xml version="1.0"?><test><foo id="myID"/></test>');
 * $qp->append('<new><elements/></new>')->writeHTML();
 * ?>
 * </code>
 *
 * The above would print (formatted for readability):
 * <code>
 * <?xml version="1.0"?>
 * <test>
 *  <foo id="myID">
 *    <new>
 *      <element/>
 *    </new>
 *  </foo>
 * </test>
 * </code>
 *
 * To learn about the functions available to a Query Path object, 
 * see {@link QueryPath}. The {@link qp()} function is used to build
 * new QueryPath objects. The documentation for that function explains the
 * wealth of arguments that the function can take.
 *
 * Included with the source code for QueryPath is a complete set of unit tests
 * as well as some example files. THose are good resources for learning about
 * how to apply QueryPath's tools.
 *
 * If you are interested in building extensions for QueryParser, see the 
 * {@link QueryPathExtender} class. There, you will find information on adding
 * your own tools to QueryPath.
 *
 * QueryPath also comes with a full CSS 3 selector parser implementation. If
 * you are interested in reusing that in other code, you will want to start
 * with {@link CssEventHandler.php}, which is the event interface for the parser.
 *
 * If you want to learn the nitty gritty details of QueryPath, you can take a 
 * look at the implementation in {@link QueryPathImpl.php}. There you will find
 * the "real" code.

 * Build a new Query Path.
 * This builds a new Query Path object. The new object can be used for 
 * reading, search, and modifying a document.
 *
 * While it is permissible to directly create new instances of a QueryPath
 * implementation, it is not advised. Instead, you should use this function
 * as a factory.
 *
 * Example:
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * qp(); // New empty QueryPath
 * qp('path/to/file.xml'); // From a file
 * qp('<html><head></head><body></body></html>'); // From HTML or XML
 * qp(QueryPath::HTML_STUB); // From a basic HTML document.
 * qp(QueryPath::HTML_STUB, 'title'); // Create one from a basic HTML doc and position it at the title element.
 *
 * // Most of the time, methods are chained directly off of this call.
 * qp(QueryPath::HTML_STUB, 'body')->append('<h1>Title</h1>')->addClass('body-class');
 * ?>
 * </code>
 *
 * This function is used internally by QueryPath. Anything that modifies the
 * behavior of this function may also modify the behavior of common QueryPath
 * methods.
 *
 * @param mixed $document
 *  A document in one of the following forms:
 *  - A string of XML or HTML (See {@link HTML_STUB})
 *  - A path on the file system or a URL
 *  - A {@link DOMDocument} object
 *  - A {@link SimpleXMLElement} object.
 *  - A {@link DOMNode} object.
 *  - An array of {@link DOMNode} objects (generally {@link DOMElement} nodes).
 *  - Another {@link QueryPath} object.
 *
 * Keep in mind that most features of QueryPath operate on elements. Other 
 * sorts of DOMNodes might not work with all features.
 * @param string $string 
 *  A CSS 3 selector.
 * @param array $options
 *  An associative array of options. Currently supported options are:
 *  - context: A stream context object. This is used to pass context info
 *    to the underlying file IO subsystem.
 *  - parser_flags: An OR-combined set of parser flags. The flags supported
 *    by the DOMDocument PHP class are all supported here.

   * <code>
   * <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
   * <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

   *
   * In jQuery or a browser-based solution, you generally do not need a branching
   * function because there is (implicitly) only one document. In QueryPath, there
   * is no implicit document. Every document must be explicitly specified (and,
